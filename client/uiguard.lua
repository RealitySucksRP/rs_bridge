    rs_bridge -- keybind guard for full-screen UIs

    ox_inventory calls SetNuiFocusKeepInput(true) so it can decide for itself
    which controls survive while the inventory is open. That means raw game input
    keeps flowing. ox then calls DisableAllControlActions(0) every frame, which
    stops standard controls -- but a command bound through RegisterKeyMapping is
    dispatched by the command system, NOT as a control, so DisableControlAction
    has no effect on it. Every other resource's menu keybind therefore still
    fires while the player is dragging items around the inventory, which is why
    other menus open mid-drag.

    This file is included with '@rs_bridge/client/uiguard.lua', so it runs inside
    each consuming resource's own Lua VM. Overriding the two natives here guards
    that resource without editing any of its own code, and without every resource
    needing to learn about ox_inventory.

    MUST be listed FIRST in client_scripts, ahead of the resource's own files --
    the overrides have to exist before that resource calls RegisterCommand or
    RegisterKeyMapping.
