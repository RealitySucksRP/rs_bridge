-- Networked entity ownership
--
-- Under OneSync an entity created with isNetwork = true is registered on
-- the server, and ONLY the client that currently owns it may delete it.
-- Calling DeleteEntity without ownership silently does nothing: the entity
-- stays registered server-side forever. A resource that spawns and despawns
-- networked peds/vehicles/props in a loop therefore leaks an entity per
-- cycle, and the server degrades until it dies.
--
-- This was the proven cause of the rs-phone open/close crash and the
-- rs-weaponshops target-practice crash. These helpers exist so every RS
-- resource fixes it the same way instead of hand-rolling the dance.
--
-- Pure natives, so this is framework-agnostic and safe on Qbox, QBCore
-- and ESX alike.

--
-- Resources route teardown through the same cleanup functions they use during
-- normal play, so the call sites cannot tell which context they are in. This
-- flag lets them stay unchanged and still degrade to non-blocking automatically.
--
-- This file is listed FIRST in each consumer's client_scripts, so this handler
-- registers first and therefore runs before the resource's own stop handler.
